# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset.
The goal is to understand the data distribution, relationships between
features, and identify important features for prediction.

## Dataset
- Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Performed
- Distribution of numerical features using histograms
- Identification of outliers using box plots
- Analysis of feature relationships using correlation heatmap
- Basic insights derived from visualizations

## Deliverables
- EDA Notebook (Jupyter Notebook)
- Visual insights included within the notebook

## Outcome
This analysis helps in understanding data patterns, feature behavior,
and selecting important features for machine learning models.
